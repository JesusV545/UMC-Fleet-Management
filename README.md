## 🧠 Why This Exists

As part of a private ambulance company, fleet maintenance was often managed manually — using whiteboards or spreadsheets. This app was created to:

- Provide better visibility into fleet status  
- Ensure timely vehicle inspections and compliance  
- Digitally centralize all unit condition reports and maintenance activity
